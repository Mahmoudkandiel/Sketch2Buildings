## Project Overview
This project implements a **Sketch-to-Real Building Image Generator** using the Pix2Pix Conditional GAN. The system is trained to translate architectural sketches into realistic building images, providing a powerful tool for architects, designers, and visualization experts.

## Dataset
The project uses the **House Thumbnail Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramiromep/house-thumbnail)), which contains images of houses. The dataset was preprocessed to generate paired data:
- **Original Images**: Realistic images of buildings.
- **Sketches**: Generated by converting the original images into black-and-white line drawings using edge detection techniques.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on the Pix2Pix Conditional GAN architecture, which uses:
- **Generator**: U-Net-based architecture for generating realistic images from sketches.
- **Discriminator**: PatchGAN discriminator to evaluate the realism of generated images and their correspondence to the input sketch.

The official TensorFlow tutorial on Pix2Pix ([link](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/pix2pix)) was referenced and adapted for this project.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Download the House Thumbnail Dataset from Kaggle.
   - Convert real images to sketches using edge detection.
   - Pair the sketches with their corresponding real images.

2. **Model Setup**:
   - Build and compile the Pix2Pix model using TensorFlow.
   - Use the U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the model using paired sketch-real image datasets.
   - Monitor training with loss metrics and intermediate results.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Generate realistic building images from new sketches.
   - Assess the quality using visual inspection and qualitative feedback.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle API (for dataset download)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib kaggle
```

## Usage
1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Use the Kaggle API or download the dataset manually from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramiromep/house-thumbnail)).

2. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Convert images to sketches using a Python script or an edge-detection library (e.g., OpenCV).

3. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the training script to train the Pix2Pix model on the paired dataset.

4. **Generate Results**:
   - Input new sketches to the trained model to generate realistic building images.
